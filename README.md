## [Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe#Rules)

## Interactions
To play this game, just click on the mode you want (2 player, easy AI, or Advanced AI).
From there, just play the game as explained in the rules.

## Implemented Features
The program consists of a main menu and game screen. 
The main menu lets you pick who you want to go against as your opponent. 
The game screen lets you play and lets you go back to the menu or just restart the game with current settings. 

### The AI
The easy AI is just randomly picking available spaces. The advanced AI is a really dumb minimax algo that has a very small depth. It is "advanced" not smart. 

## Separation of work
The project was evenly split between both contributors. The only thing not split was the AI logic. That was handled by CoderJoshDK.
